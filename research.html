  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>This research outlines a real-time behavioral framework developed for EmoPet AI—an interactive platform that helps children manage emotions through playful interaction with two holographic pets: Fritz the Dog and Lulù the Cat. Using a combination of observational feedback, linguistic adaptation, and guided activities, the system aims to identify emotional states such as joy, sadness, anxiety, or boredom through children's interactions. EmoPet does not collect biometric data but instead relies on responsive storytelling, mood-based game selection, and language-driven feedback loops to offer personalized support.</p>

<h2>Observed Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Children aged 6–12 experiencing emotional stress or social isolation</li>
  <li><strong>Mode:</strong> Web-based interface with touch and voice feedback</li>
  <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Italian, English (C1), and French (ESABAC diploma track)</li>
  <li><strong>Character Profiles:</strong> Fritz (curious and active), Lulù (gentle and imaginative)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scientific Collaboration</h2>
<p>The framework is currently evaluated under guidance of Dr. Diana, an expert in therapeutic ecosystems and member of the Blue Zone movement. His support is helping refine narrative triggers and thematic environments that contribute to emotional regulation in children.</p>

<h2>Planned Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>New ambient story backgrounds (forest, classroom, fantasy worlds)</li>
  <li>Voice narration for story chapters and customized endings</li>
  <li>Parent feedback dashboard to track child interaction trends</li>
</ul>
